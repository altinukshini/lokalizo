<dl>
    <h2>What is Lokalizo?</h2>
    <dt>Is this a municipality website?</dt>
    <dd>No, it isn't – but Lokalizo does send your reports direct to your local government. We also publish them online, so that others in the community can read, discuss, and offer advice where needed.</dd>

    <dt>Then who are you? And why are you doing this?</dt>
    <dd>Lokalizo is an independent website, built by the non-profit organization Prosperity Initiative in Kosovo (PIKS). We wanted to make it easier to report problems in your community, even if you don't know who those reports should go to. 
    <br />So we made Lokalizo. All you have to do is type in a road, neighborhood, city – or let the site locate you automatically – and describe your problem. Then we send your report to the people whose job it is to fix it. 
    <br />Lokalizo covers the whole of Kosovo. No matter where you are, the only thing you ever have to remember is our web address – Lokalizo.org.</dd>

    <dt>Do municipalities read or act on Lokalizo reports?</dt>
    <dd>They certainly do. Reports sent through Lokalizo go into the same municipality email inboxes as reports sent through by any other means.</dd>

    <dt>How can I contact you?</dt>
    <dd>You can use [<a href="/contact">this form</a>] – but please see whether these FAQs answer your question first, because that saves your time and ours.</dd>

    <dt>Is there a Lokalizo app?</dt>
    <dd>Yes – there's an app for iOS and an Android app. If your phone isn't supported, try accessing Lokalizo via your mobile internet browser – it should work well.</dd>

    <h2>Using Lokalizo</h2>
    <dt>How do I make a report?</dt>
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>Start at the homepage and type in your streetname, neighborhood or city name. Not sure where you are? Pick 'locate me automatically'.</li>
            <li>Put the pin in the map to show exactly where the problem is, and type in a description of the issue. Then send.</li>
            <li>Check your email inbox for our confirmation mail, click on the link, and job done.</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt>What can I report?</dt>
    <dd>On Lokalizo you will find the opportunity to report on things which the municipality is able to fix. You will find a few categories of problems, but generally you can report broken or dirty or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning or clearing, like accumulation of garbage, potholes or street lights that don't work, broken water pipes, broken electric masts, a failing or risky infrastructure or construction site, danger from a broken tree, illegal logging, erosion, etc.</dd>

    <dt>What shouldn't I report?</dt>
    <dd>
        Please see our <a href="/about/rules">House Rules</a> for things you shouldn’t report, or include in your report.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Urgent issues:</strong> For problems that might put people in immediate danger, like fires, gas leaks falling trees, potential landslides, failing streets or highway, please report through the disaster risk reduction category or even contact directly your municipality emergency hotline, or the appropriate utility company or emergency service.</li> 
            <li><strong>Non-physical things:</strong> For issues such as noise pollution, barking dogs, proposals for speed bumps or pedestrian crossings, please use the other category or contact the municipality directly.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Are reports public?</dt>
    <dd>Yes they are: when you submit your report, we send it to the municipality, and we also publish it on the website. Your municipality will respond directly to you, and from that point on, your correspondence is one-to-one. <br>For that reason, we suggest that you don't include personal details such as addresses and phone numbers until you are in direct communication.</dd>

    <dt>Why are reports public?</dt>
    <dd>Putting your reports online has several benefits. Others can quickly see what has already been reported, so it prevents the municipality from having to deal with duplicates. It also creates a snapshot for local communities, so it's easy to see what the common problems are in a given area, and how quickly they get fixed. Other local residents can browse, read and comment on problems – and perhaps even offer a solution.</dd>

    <dt>Why do I have to give my name and an email address?</dt>
    <dd>For a few reasons: firstly, we need your email address so that the municipality can get back to you. <br>Also, messages sent via Lokalizo go into municipality systems. In most cases a full name is a mandatory field, and your report may be rejected without it. <br>Finally, we find that when users are asked to provide contact details, the tone of their correspondence tends to be more constructive and less abusive. <br>We don't publish your email address, and you can opt to submit your report anonymously – just uncheck the 'show my name publicly' box on submission. This will mean that your name is not displayed on the Lokalizo website, although it is still sent to the municipality.</dd>

    <h2>Accounts and alerts</h2>
    <dt>Do I need to register with Lokalizo to use it?</dt>
    <dd>No – you can send a report without registering. When you submit your report, we'll send you an email with a confirmation link.
    <br>If you use Lokalizo a lot, you can avoid this step by creating an account. Once you've signed in, your reports will be sent as soon as you click 'submit'. <br>You'll also be able to see all previous reports you've made on one page.</dd>

    <dt>How do I register?</dt>
    <dd>Visit the <a href="/auth">auth</a> and choose 'No, let me sign in by email'. You can choose a password at that point.</dd>

    <dt>I've forgotten my password</dt>
    <dd>Don't worry! Visit the <a href="/auth">auth</a> and choose 'No, let me sign in by email' - then put a new password in the box. You'll receive an email to confirm the change. <br>I want to change my password or email address. <br>You can do this from your <a href="/my">account page</a>.</dd>

    <dt>What are alerts?</dt>
    <dd>Lokalizo lets you sign up to receive an email every time someone reports a problem in your chosen area – visit <a href="/alert">alert page</a> to see what's available. This is a free service.</dd>

    <dt>I want to stop receiving alerts</dt>
    <dd>There is an unsubscribe link at the end of every alert email – please click on this and you'll be immediately unsubscribed.</dd>

    <h2>When things don't go as planned</h2>
    <dt>The site isn't working</dt>
    <dd>First, check your internet connection is ok. You may also like to check our Facebook feed, where we announce any known issues or downtime. <br>If there are no problems at your end or ours, please wait a few minutes, and then try again. <br>If you still can't get things to work, <a href="/contact">drop us a line</a>. <br>Please include the wording of any error message you see displayed, which browser you are using (eg Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari), whether you're on a desktop or mobile computer, and anything else that might be relevant.</dd>

    <dt>My street isn't on your map</dt>
    <dd>Lokalizo's default maps are from OpenStreetMap. If you can't see the street you want to make a report on, your best bet is to describe the problem location in as much detail as possible, as well as using the map to pinpoint it.</dd>

    <dt>There are too many pins on the map; I can't make a report</dt>
    <dd>Use the buttons at the bottom right of the screen – 'hide pins', or 'hide old pins', to clear the map.</dd>

    <dt>There's no category for what I want to report</dt>
    <dd>The categories on Lokalizo are set by each individual municipality, and reflect the problems that they are able to deal with. <br>There is almost always an 'other' option, but if your problem doesn't fit neatly into any of the given categories, please consider whether Lokalizo is the appropriate place to report it (see "What can I report?", above).</dd>

    <dt>I haven't received a confirmation email</dt>
    <dd>Please check your spam folder – this is the most common reason that confirmation emails cannot be found. <br>Unfortunately, it is hard for us to avoid from our end, but by adding us to your email whitelist, you will prevent this happening in future.</dd>

    <dt>You sent my report to the wrong place</dt>
    <dd>Please check that you placed your pin correctly, and chose the right category for your report. If your problem is very near a municipality boundary, it is easy to place the pin on the wrong side of it by mistake. Similarly, choosing the wrong category can mean that your report is sent to one municipality when it should have gone to another. <br>If the above two paragraphs do not apply, please drop us a line and we'll try to get to the bottom of why your report has been misrouted. Please include the URL (web address) of your Lokalizo report.</dd>

    <dt>I want to update my report</dt>
    <dd>If you've already submitted your report, but now you need to send further information to your municipality, you should wait until they reply to you, and then respond to their communication directly. <br>You can also leave an update on your Lokalizo report page, but note that updates are not forwarded to the municipality. They are intended as a place for residents to discuss local problems and offer advice or support. <br> With this in mind, you may wish to both update your report on the site, and contact your municipality via email.</dd>

    <dt>I want to edit my report</dt>
    <dd>It's not possible to edit a report once it has been sent to the municipality. However, if you have a good reason for editing the text on the website (for example, you have included your phone number by mistake, or you intended your report to be anonymous) contact us and we will edit it for you. <br>Please include the URL (web address) of your Lokalizo report when you contact us. <br>Note that edits on the site are not sent to the municipality, so if your edit is vital to the problem being fixed, please respond to your municipality when they reply to your initial report. <br>We cannot alter the position of a pin once it has been placed.</dd>

    <dt>I do not wish to make a public report</dt>
    <dd>All reports made through Lokalizo are published online. Reports can be submitted anonymously: just check the box when you fill in the form. Note that the body of your report will still appear on the Lokalizo website, but without your name attached to it, and that your name will still be sent to the municipality. <br>If your report contains potentially sensitive material, such as names or addresses, we suggest that you do not include these until the municipality has replied to you directly and you are in one-to-one contact. <br>If your report is not suitable for publication, you should contact your municipality directly, via the contact details given on their own website.</dd>

    <dt>I've seen an inappropriate report/comment</dt>
    <dd>There's a 'report abuse' button at the foot of every Lokalizo report. Please click on this and we'll take a look as soon as we can. <br> If the report or comment is contravening our <a href="/about/rules">House Rules</a>, we'll take it down.</dd>

    <h2>What now?</h2>
    <dt>My problem hasn't been fixed, what do I do now?</dt>
    <dd>Lokalizo is great for reporting problems, but we don't fix them – your municipality oversees that. <br>If you'd like to chase your municipality, try replying to their most recent correspondence to you – or if you only have an auto-response, you may be able to find further contact details there. <br>If you still have no joy, we suggest starting a new Lokalizo report.</dd>

    <dt>Someone has marked my problem was fixed, but it isn't</dt>
    <dd>As the owner of your report on Lokalizo, you can change its status back to 'not fixed' at any time. Go to your report's web page and check the box under 'update'.</dd>

    <dt>My report is old and my problem has been fixed. Can I now delete it?</dt>
    <dd>We currently have a policy of retaining all Lokalizo reports: we believe they contribute a useful historic picture of communities across the country. They've even been used in academic research, to study, for example, what the common problems are in an area, or how potholes are distributed across the country. <br>As new reports are made, older ones drop off the first page for any given area, and are less likely to be discovered by those visiting the site.</dd>

    <h2>Feedback and ideas</h2>
    <dt>Lokalizo really works</dt>
