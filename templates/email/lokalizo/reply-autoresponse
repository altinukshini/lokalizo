Subject: Automatic reply to your message to Lokalizo

Hello,

You are receiving this message because you have tried to reply to an automated
email from Lokalizo.

This is an automatic response to your email.

If you are trying to contact your municipality about a report you have made, please
search your email for their latest communication (or auto-reply), and respond
to that.

Alternatively, if you would like your comment to be published on our website,
you can post it as an update to the original report. Note, however, that updates
are not sent to the municipality - they are a way for residents to discuss local
problems and offer advice or support. With this in mind, you may wish to both
update your original report, and chase your municipality via email.

If you would like to respond to our question about whether your problem has
been fixed, please follow the link in the email we sent you.

If you are trying to reply to an update someone has left on your report, please
visit your report page on Lokalizo and enter your response in the 'update'
box.

If you are trying to confirm a report or an email alert, please click the link
in the email that we sent you, or, if you cannot click the link, copy and paste
it into the address bar of your web browser.

If you're trying to unsubscribe from an email alert, there is an unsubscribe
link at the bottom of the email.

All the best,

The Lokalizo team
